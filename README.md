## üì¶ Overview

This repository is a **starter template** for microservice architecture in Python using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [WSO2 API Manager](https://wso2.com/api-management/). It provides a basic but expandable setup with:

- ‚úÖ Auth service (JWT-based)
- ‚úÖ API Gateway (WSO2)
- ‚úÖ Example domain services: `service-a`, `service-b`, `service-c`
- ‚úÖ Clean structure for onboarding teams or prototyping

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is not a production-ready system, but a **semi-finished scaffold** to experiment with gatewayed microservices in Python.
